# Technical Details: Local File Converter v1.0

## 1. Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React (Latest stable version)
- **Core Logic:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **High-Performance Processing:** WebAssembly (WASM)
  - Source: Compiled from C/C++/Rust using tools like Emscripten or wasm-pack.
  - Responsibility: Team to source, evaluate, compile (if needed), and integrate WASM libraries.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Web Workers API
- **File Handling:** HTML5 File API (FileReader, Blob, File objects)
- **Build Tool:** Webpack (configured for React, WASM, and Workers support)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI library (for maintainable, component-based UI)
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Allowed, but require team vetting (suitability, performance, security, license).
- **Hosting:** Static web hosting (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3+CloudFront, GitHub Pages).

## 2. WebAssembly Implementation

### 2.1 WASM Libraries and Modules

The following libraries have been identified for implementing the required conversion types:

#### Document Conversions
- **PDF Processing:** PDF.js (Mozilla) - For reading/parsing PDF files
- **DOCX Processing:** docx.js - For creating and manipulating DOCX files
- **PDF Creation:** pdf-lib - For creating and manipulating PDF files

#### Media Conversions
- **Audio/Video Processing:** ffmpeg.wasm - WebAssembly port of FFmpeg for browser-based media conversion
  - Handles MP4, MOV, MP3, GIF conversions
  - Optimized build to reduce size and improve performance

#### Special Formats
- **HEIC Processing:** heic-decode or libheif.js - For HEIC image format support

### 2.2 WASM Module Architecture

- **Modular Structure:**
  - WASM modules are organized by file type categories (document, media, image)
  - Each module is loaded on demand based on conversion needs
  - Shared utilities for common operations across modules

- **Memory Management:**
  - Implement efficient buffer handling to minimize copying
  - Use transferable objects where possible
  - Consider memory limitations (particularly for near-100MB files)
  - Implement cleanup strategies to reclaim memory after conversion

- **Progress Reporting:**
  - Standardized progress API for all WASM modules
  - Regular updates during processing (0-100%)
  - Fallback to indeterminate progress when precise reporting not available

### 2.3 Integration Strategy

- **Worker Interface Layer:**
  - Abstract communication between Web Workers and WASM modules
  - Standardized message protocol for all conversions
  - Error handling and recovery mechanisms

- **Lazy Loading Strategy:**
  - Load WASM modules only when required
  - Consider preloading strategies for common conversion types
  - Implement loading indicators for WASM module initialization

## 3. Performance Requirements & Considerations

- **Goal:** Aim for the "fastest possible" client-side conversion (subjective, no specific v1.0 benchmarks).
- **Optimization Strategies:**
  - Profile and optimize WASM execution.
  - Minimize data copying between main thread and workers (use transferable objects).
  - Efficient memory management (revoke object URLs promptly).
  - Lazy-load conversion modules.
- **WebAssembly Optimization:**
  - Use optimized WASM compilation settings
  - Consider SIMD instructions where available
  - Balance between file size and performance
- **Limitations:** Acknowledge performance variance based on user hardware/browser, especially for large/complex files (within 100MB limit).

## 4. Security Requirements

- **Primary Mechanism:** Local processing (no server uploads).
- **Transport:** MUST use HTTPS.
- **Mitigation:** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).
- **Vetting:** All 3rd-party JS/WASM libraries MUST be vetted (vulnerabilities, licenses).
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Be mindful of potential browser DoS from malicious files during conversion; implement safeguards (e.g., timeouts) if possible within libraries.
- **WASM Security:**
  - Validate input before passing to WASM modules
  - Implement memory limits and timeouts for conversions
  - Clean up resources after conversion is complete

## 5. Browser Support

- Target latest 2 stable versions of:
  - Google Chrome
  - Mozilla Firefox
  - Microsoft Edge
  - Apple Safari
- No support required for older versions or Internet Explorer.
- WebAssembly Support: Verify WASM feature compatibility across target browsers

## 6. Testing Requirements

- **Unit Testing:** Mandatory for JS/React components/utilities (high coverage).
- **Integration Testing:** Required for component, main thread, and worker interactions.
- **E2E Testing:** Recommended for core conversion workflows.
- **WASM Testing:**
  - Conversion correctness for all supported formats
  - Performance benchmarking with various file sizes
  - Memory consumption monitoring
- **Manual QA:** Performed by Project Owner.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Required across supported browsers.

## 7. Open Issues / Risks

- **Risk:** High complexity/effort for finding/building/integrating reliable & performant WASM for diverse MVP conversions. Feasibility needs validation (esp. PDF<->DOCX).
- **Risk:** "Fastest" performance goal is subjective and depends on WASM quality and user hardware.
- **Risk:** WASM module size may impact initial page load and user experience.
- **Risk:** Complex conversions (like PDF<->DOCX) may have limitations in purely client-side implementation.
- **Risk:** Undefined timeline/budget impacts prioritization and MVP scope delivery. Requires iterative planning.
- **Open Issue:** Need list of 50+ post-MVP conversion pairs to inform scalable architecture.
