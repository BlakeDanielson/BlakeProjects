# Active Context: Local File Converter

**Date:** 2025-04-25 (Phase 2 - WASM Implementation In Progress)

**Current Status:**

- Project initialization complete.
- Core memory files (`docs/product_requirement_docs.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/technical.md`, `tasks/tasks_plan.md`, `tasks/active_context.md`) have been created and populated based on the initial Technical Specification v1.0.
- Phase 1 (Setup & Core UI) implementation complete.
  - **All tasks completed:**
    - [x] **Setup-1:** Initialized React project using Webpack as the build tool.
    - [x] **Setup-2:** Configured Webpack for WASM and Web Worker support.
    - [x] **Setup-3:** Integrated styling solution (switched from CSS Modules to Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI library).
    - [x] **Setup-4:** Implemented basic application layout/shell.
    - [x] **UI-1 (F1):** Implemented file selection UI (Drag-and-drop area).
    - [x] **UI-2 (F1):** Implemented file selection UI (Browse button - `<input type="file">`).
    - [x] **UI-3 (F2):** Implemented UI for selecting target output format (dynamically populated).
    - [x] **UI-4 (F5):** Implemented basic UI for progress indication (placeholder for spinner/percentage).
    - [x] **UI-5 (F6):** Implemented UI element to display/trigger download link.
    - [x] **UI-6 (F7):** Implemented basic UI area for displaying error messages.
    - [x] **Core-1 (F3):** Implemented client-side file reading (metadata) via File API.
    - [x] **Core-2 (F3):** Implemented client-side file size validation (< 100MB).
    - [x] **Core-3:** Implemented basic Web Worker setup and communication channel (main thread <-> worker).
    - [x] **Core-4 (F7):** Implemented initial error handling framework.

- Phase 2 (Conversion Implementation) in progress:
  - **Completed:**
    - [x] Created modular worker architecture with base class and factory pattern
    - [x] Implemented image conversion worker for JPG ↔ PNG conversions using Canvas API
    - [x] Set up ConversionService as the main interface for file conversions
  
  - **In Progress:**
    - [ ] **WASM-1:** Research and evaluate PDF.js and docx.js libraries for document conversions
    - [ ] **WASM-2:** Set up WASM module structure for document conversions
    - [ ] **WASM-5:** Research and evaluate ffmpeg.wasm for media conversions
    - [ ] **WASM-8:** Research and evaluate heic-decode library for HEIC conversion

**Current Focus:**

- Transitioning from Canvas-based conversions to WebAssembly-based implementation for all required conversion formats
- Setting up the core WASM infrastructure to support all required conversion types
- Implementing document conversion with a focus on PDF ↔ DOCX conversions as the first WASM-based feature

**Next Steps (Priority Order):**

1. Complete evaluation of document conversion libraries (PDF.js, docx.js)
2. Develop a standardized pattern for integrating WASM modules with our worker architecture
3. Implement document conversion for PDF → DOCX as the first full WASM-based conversion
4. Set up a test suite to verify conversion accuracy and performance
5. Implement remaining document conversions (DOCX → PDF, JPG/PNG → PDF)
6. Proceed with media conversions using ffmpeg.wasm
7. Implement HEIC → JPG conversion

**Technical Decisions Made:**

- **Worker Architecture:** Implemented a modular worker architecture with:
  - BaseConversionWorker abstract class for common functionality
  - Specialized worker implementations for different file types
  - WorkerFactory for managing worker instances
  - ConversionService as a clean interface for the application
- **Image Conversion:** Using Canvas API for JPG ↔ PNG conversions (lightweight, no external dependencies)
- **Progress Reporting:** Standardized progress reporting from workers to UI
- **WASM Strategy:** Decided to segment WASM implementations by file type categories:
  - Document conversions (PDF, DOCX)
  - Media conversions (MP4, MP3, MOV, GIF)
  - Special format conversions (HEIC)

**Implementation Challenges:**

- Need to balance WASM module size with performance and load time
- Ensuring consistent progress reporting from various WASM libraries
- Memory management for large file conversions
- Creating a standardized interface for different WASM modules

**Open Considerations:**

- Evaluating whether to bundle all WASM modules together or implement lazy loading
- Considering implementation of a module pre-loading strategy to improve user experience
- Exploring options for optimizing WASM performance on different devices and browsers
- Investigating potential fallback strategies for browsers with limited WASM support
