This document records significant changes to the project, including major updates, additions, and modifications to its structure and functionality.

## Changes

### 2025-04-24: Fixed Test Login Feature Functionality and Redirection

**Type**: Fix
**Component**: Authentication / Testing
**Description**: Made the Test Login feature fully functional by:
1. Implementing database-independent authentication for test users by creating mock user data without requiring database access
2. Adding special handling for test users in profile and metrics retrieval
3. Fixing the login redirection by updating the Redux store with the user state after a successful test login

**Reason**: The test login feature was failing with database connection errors ("Can't reach database server at localhost:5432") and even when authentication succeeded, it wasn't redirecting properly to the dashboard.
**Affected Files**:
- execution_tasks/api_integration/src/services/auth.service.ts (updated to bypass database for test users)
- execution_tasks/frontend/unified-llm-hub/src/pages/Login.tsx (updated to use Redux actions)
- cline_docs/activeContext.md (updated)
- cline_docs/changelog.md (this file)
- .clinerules (updated with new learning journal entry)

### 2025-04-24: Fixed Test Login Feature with Manual Server Restart

**Type**: Fix
**Component**: Authentication / Testing
**Description**: Fixed the test login feature by adding the `ENABLE_TEST_AUTH=true` environment variable to the backend configuration file (`.env.local`) and manually restarting the server. Identified that nodemon was configured to ignore changes to `.env.local` in its nodemon.json configuration, which explained why the environment variable change wasn't automatically applied.
**Reason**: The test login button was visible in the frontend (enabled by `REACT_APP_ENABLE_TEST_AUTH=true`) but would fail with a 403 error because the backend was not properly configured to allow test logins. After adding the required environment variable, a manual server restart was necessary because nodemon explicitly ignores `.env.local` files.
**Affected Files**:
- execution_tasks/api_integration/.env.local (updated)
- execution_tasks/api_integration/nodemon.json (identified config issue)
- cline_docs/activeContext.md (updated)
- cline_docs/changelog.md (this file)
- .clinerules (updated with new learning journal entry)

### 2025-04-24: Added "Test Login" Feature

**Type**: Addition
**Component**: Authentication / Testing
**Description**: Implemented a "Test Login" feature allowing developers/testers to bypass standard authentication using a dedicated backend endpoint (`/auth/test-login`) and a frontend button. This feature is conditionally enabled via environment variables (`ENABLE_TEST_AUTH` for backend, `REACT_APP_ENABLE_TEST_AUTH` for frontend) and creates/uses a predefined test user (`test@example.com`).
**Reason**: To facilitate easier testing of application flows that require authentication without needing valid user credentials during development.
**Affected Files**:
- execution_tasks/api_integration/src/services/auth.service.ts (updated)
- execution_tasks/api_integration/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts (updated)
- execution_tasks/api_integration/src/routes/auth.routes.ts (updated)

### 2025-04-24: Attempted Fix for TypeScript Error in Analytics Service

**Type**: Fix
**Component**: Backend API / Analytics
**Description**: Modified the `getAggregates` function in `analytics.service.ts` to map Prisma results, converting `null` percentile values (`p50`, `p95`, `p99`) to `undefined` to align with the function's return type signature.
**Reason**: To resolve the TypeScript error TS2322 (`Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'number | undefined'`). The error persisted after this change, suggesting a potential caching issue with `nodemon` or `ts-node`.
**Affected Files**:
- execution_tasks/api_integration/src/services/analytics.service.ts (updated)
- cline_docs/activeContext.md (updated)
- cline_docs/changelog.md (this file)
- .clinerules (updated)

### 2025-04-24: Added Missing Stripe Secret Key

**Type**: Fix
**Component**: Backend API / Configuration
**Description**: Added the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable with a placeholder value to `execution_tasks/api_integration/.env.local`.
**Reason**: To resolve the runtime error "Error: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is not defined in environment variables" encountered in `subscription.service.ts`.
**Affected Files**:
- execution_tasks/api_integration/.env.local (updated)
- cline_docs/activeContext.md (updated)
- cline_docs/changelog.md (this file)
- .clinerules (updated)

### 2025-04-24: Resolved Prisma Client Generation Error

**Type**: Fix
**Component**: Backend API / Database
**Description**: Ran `npx prisma generate` within the `execution_tasks/api_integration` directory to generate the Prisma Client.
**Reason**: To resolve the runtime error "Error: @prisma/client did not initialize yet. Please run "prisma generate" and try to import it again." which occurred because the client was not generated after schema changes or initial setup.
**Affected Files**:
- execution_tasks/api_integration/src/generated/prisma/* (generated files)
- cline_docs/activeContext.md (updated)
- cline_docs/changelog.md (this file)
- .clinerules (updated)
