# Active Context

## Current State
The project is now in the Execution phase with significant progress on multiple implementation tasks. We have completed the implementation of the API Integration Architecture for the UnifiedLLM Hub, providing a unified interface to multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini) with optimized performance, error handling, and security features. We have created the frontend implementation with core UI components and integrated it with the backend API layer, establishing proper communication between the frontend and the LLM providers through the API. We've implemented a complete JWT-based authentication system with Neon PostgreSQL as the database backend (Migrated from SQLite), implemented the conversation history management system for persistent storage and retrieval of user interactions with the LLMs, a dashboard with usage metrics to display real-time subscription usage data, a comprehensive subscription management system with Stripe integration for handling paid plans, an analytics system to track and visualize system performance metrics, user role management with admin functionality for user administration, and enhanced login security with a show password toggle feature. We've also implemented a fully functional Test Login feature that works without requiring database access, making it easier to test the application during development.
