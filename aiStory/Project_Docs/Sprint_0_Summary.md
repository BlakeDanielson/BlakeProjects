# Sprint 0 Summary: Foundation Setup

**Objective:**

To establish a solid foundation for the AI Story Creator project, including setting up the Git repository, managing backend dependencies, initializing the FastAPI project, configuring the database, defining the API contract, and initializing the Flutter project.

**Completed Tasks:**

*   **Git Repository Setup:**
    *   Initialized a Git repository for version control.
    *   Configured a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files.
    *   Established a branching strategy for development.
*   **Backend Dependency Management (Poetry):**
    *   Chose Poetry for managing backend dependencies.
    *   Created a `pyproject.toml` file to define dependencies.
    *   Set up a virtual environment for the project.
*   **FastAPI Initialization and Health Endpoint:**
    *   Initialized a FastAPI project structure.
    *   Implemented a health endpoint for monitoring the API.
    *   Configured basic settings for the FastAPI application.
*   **Database Configuration with SQLAlchemy and Alembic:**
    *   Configured a database connection using SQLAlchemy.
    *   Set up Alembic for database migrations.
    *   Created initial database models.
*   **API Contract Definition:**
    *   Defined the API contract using OpenAPI specifications.
    *   Documented the API endpoints and data models.
*   **Flutter Project Initialization:**
    *   Initialized a Flutter project structure for the frontend.
    *   Configured basic settings for the Flutter application.

**Lessons Learned and Best Practices:**

*   **Dependency Management:** Poetry is a powerful tool for managing Python dependencies, but it's important to keep the `pyproject.toml` file up-to-date and resolve any dependency conflicts promptly.
*   **API Design:** Following RESTful principles and using OpenAPI specifications can greatly improve the maintainability and scalability of the API.
*   **Database Migrations:** Alembic is essential for managing database schema changes in a controlled and reproducible manner.
*   **Project Structure:** Maintaining a clean and well-organized project structure is crucial for long-term maintainability.
*   **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation is essential for onboarding new team members and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

**Next Steps:**

*   Proceed to Sprint 1: Authentication & Authorization.
*   Implement user registration and login endpoints.
*   Define user roles and permissions.
*   Secure API endpoints with authentication and authorization checks.
