# Photo Upload Implementation Details

## Photo Upload Pipeline

The photo upload pipeline consists of the following steps:

1.  The Frontend sends the photo to the Backend API endpoint (`/photos`).
2.  The Backend validates the file:
    *   Checks the file's magic number to ensure it matches the expected file type (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
    *   Validates the file size to prevent excessively large uploads.
    *   Performs other necessary validations (e.g., file extension).
3.  The Backend streams the file to the configured Storage Service (Local or S3). Streaming is used to handle large files efficiently and prevent memory issues.
4.  The Backend saves the photo metadata to the database, including the file name, storage location, and upload timestamp.
5.  The Backend triggers an AI processing task using Celery. This task is responsible for processing the image using AI algorithms.

## Security Enhancements

The following security enhancements are implemented to protect against potential vulnerabilities:

*   **Magic Number Checks:** The Backend verifies the file's magic number to ensure it matches the expected file type. This prevents malicious users from uploading files with disguised extensions (e.g., a PHP script disguised as a JPEG image).
*   **Streaming Uploads:** The Backend uses streaming uploads to handle large files efficiently and prevent memory issues. This also reduces the risk of denial-of-service attacks.
*   **XSS Prevention:** The application sanitizes user input and uses appropriate content security policies (CSPs) to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **CORS Configuration:** The application is configured with strict Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to restrict cross-origin requests and prevent unauthorized access to resources.
