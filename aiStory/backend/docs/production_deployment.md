# Production Deployment Considerations

## Scaling Considerations

*   Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple backend instances.
*   Use a CDN to cache static assets (e.g., images).
*   Scale the Redis and Celery instances as needed to handle the volume of AI processing tasks.
*   Use a database with horizontal scaling capabilities to handle the growing volume of data.

## Monitoring and Logging

*   Implement comprehensive logging to track application behavior and identify potential issues.
*   Use a monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track key metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and request latency.
*   Set up alerts to notify administrators of critical issues, such as high error rates or slow response times.

## Security Best Practices

*   Use HTTPS to encrypt all traffic between the client and the server.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access.
*   Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   Ensure the production environment (e.g., EC2 instance, ECS task, Lambda function) has an IAM role with the necessary permissions to access required AWS services (like Rekognition for AI processing, S3 for storage). Use least privilege principles.
*   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
