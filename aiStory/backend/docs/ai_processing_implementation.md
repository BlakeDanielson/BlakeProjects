# AI Processing Implementation Details

## AI Processing Service Architecture

The AI Processing Service is responsible for processing images using AI algorithms. It can be implemented as a separate microservice or as a module within the Backend.

The service uses a factory pattern (`backend/services/ai_processing/factory.py`) to support different AI providers. This allows the system to easily switch between different AI providers (e.g., local dummy provider, external AI provider) without modifying the core logic.

The following AI providers are available:

*   **Local Dummy Provider:** A dummy AI provider that returns predefined results. This is useful for testing and development purposes.
*   **AWS Rekognition Provider:** An AI provider that uses AWS Rekognition for image labeling. Requires AWS credentials and configuration (see Configuration Guide).
*   **External AI Provider:** An AI provider that uses an external API to process images.

## Asynchronous Processing Workflow

The asynchronous processing workflow consists of the following steps:

1.  The Backend sends a processing task to Celery, which is queued in Redis.
2.  Celery executes the task using the AI Processing Service.
3.  The AI Processing Service retrieves the image from the Storage Service.
4.  The AI Processing Service processes the image using the configured AI provider.
5.  The AI Processing Service stores the results in the Backend.
6.  The Backend updates the photo metadata and notifies the Frontend.
