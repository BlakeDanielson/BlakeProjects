# Photo Upload and AI Image Processing Architecture Overview

## Components Diagram

(Diagram will be added here - to be created separately)

The system consists of the following components:

*   **Frontend:** The user interface for uploading photos and viewing results.
*   **Backend:** The server-side application that handles photo uploads, storage, and AI processing requests.
*   **AI Processing Service:** The service responsible for processing images using AI algorithms.
*   **Storage Service:** The service responsible for storing and retrieving photos and processed images. This can be either a local storage or an S3 bucket.
*   **Redis:** A caching and message broker used for asynchronous task management.
*   **Celery:** A task queue used for distributing AI processing tasks.

## Data Flow

1.  The user uploads a photo from the Frontend.
2.  The Frontend sends the photo to the Backend.
3.  The Backend stores the photo in the Storage Service (Local or S3).
4.  The Backend sends a processing task to Celery, which is queued in Redis.
5.  Celery executes the task using the AI Processing Service.
6.  The AI Processing Service processes the image.
7.  The AI Processing Service stores the results in the Backend.
8.  The Backend updates the photo metadata and notifies the Frontend.

## System Boundaries and Interfaces

*   **Frontend:** Interacts with the user and the Backend API.
*   **Backend:** Interacts with the Frontend, Storage Service, AI Processing Service, Redis, and Celery.
*   **External AI Provider:** (If applicable) Provides AI processing capabilities via an external API.
*   **External Storage Provider:** (If applicable) Provides storage capabilities via an external API (e.g., AWS S3).
