# Technical Details - Songwriter Connect v1.0 (MVP)

This document outlines key technical details based on `techspec.md`.

## 1. Technology Stack

*   **Database:** Neo4j (Latest stable version)
*   **Search Index:** Elasticsearch or Algolia (Team to evaluate based on features/cost/complexity)
*   **Backend:**
    *   Language: Python (Latest stable version)
    *   Framework: Flask or Django (Team preference)
    *   Libraries: Neo4j driver (e.g., `neo4j-python-driver`), library for chosen search index.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Framework: React / Next.js (Latest stable versions) preferred.
    *   Tooling: Standard tools (Node.js, npm/yarn).
*   **Hosting:** Suitable platform for hosting backend API, database, search index, and frontend (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku, Vercel).

## 2. Development Setup

*   (To be defined - Standard setup for Python/Node.js development expected)

## 3. Key Technical Decisions

*   Use of Neo4j Graph Database.
*   Use of dedicated Search Index (Elasticsearch/Algolia).
*   Preference for Python backend (Flask/Django) and React/Next.js frontend.
*   Mobile-first responsive design approach.

## 4. Design Patterns

*   (To be defined - Standard patterns for chosen frameworks likely, e.g., MVC/MVT for backend, Component-based for frontend).

## 5. Technical Constraints / Considerations

*   **Performance:**
    *   Database Query Speed: Neo4j queries must be optimized.
    *   Search Speed: Search results via Elasticsearch/Algolia should be near-instantaneous.
    *   API Response Times: Backend API endpoints should respond quickly.
    *   Frontend Performance: React/Next.js app should load quickly, feel responsive (optimize bundles, rendering).
*   **Security:**
    *   Standard web application security practices (input validation, XSS/CSRF protection).
    *   Secure configuration of database and search index (access controls, network security).
    *   Responsible handling of optional contact info from suggestion form.
    *   Ensure scraping activities are ethical and compliant (respect robots.txt, ToS).
*   **Browser Support:**
    *   Latest 2 stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari (desktop and mobile).
*   **Testing:**
    *   Backend: Unit/integration tests (API endpoints, DB interactions, ingestion logic).
    *   Frontend: Unit/integration tests (components, state, API interactions), E2E tests (core flows).
    *   Data: Validation scripts for consistency/integrity.
    *   Manual QA: Focus on data accuracy, search/filter correctness, usability across devices.

## 6. UI/UX Principles

*   **Responsibility:** Development team.
*   **Core Principles:** Clean, data-focused, intuitive navigation, professional aesthetic. Prioritize clear information hierarchy. Easy-to-use search/filter. Mobile-first.
