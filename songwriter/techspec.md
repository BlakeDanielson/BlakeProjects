Status: Final Draft
1. Overview / Introduction

This document outlines the technical specifications for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of "Songwriter Connect" (tentative name). This web application will serve as a high-accuracy information portal focused on mainstream pop songwriters active from 2000 onwards. It will feature detailed songwriter profiles including credits, awards, and production information, powered by a robust search and filtering engine. The underlying data structure will utilize a graph database to facilitate future expansion into network visualization, but this MVP version will not include a graphical network visualization interface. The application will prioritize data accuracy and mobile responsiveness.

G1 (Core Content): Deliver dedicated, detailed pages for mainstream pop (2000+) Songwriters, including comprehensive credits (writers, producers), awards/nominations, and basic biographical information.
G2 (Data Structure): Store relationship data in a Graph Database (Neo4j) to support future visualization features.
G3 (Data Accuracy): Achieve a high level of accuracy for credits and associated metadata through a combination of vetted API sources, permissible public scraping (with guidance), and a verified user suggestion system.
G4 (Search & Filter): Implement robust search and filtering capabilities comparable to Genius.com (excluding lyric search), allowing users to effectively find and filter songwriters, songs, artists, and albums.
G5 (Associated Entities): Provide basic pages for Artists, Songs, and Albums primarily as linking hubs to showcase songwriter involvement.
G6 (User Experience): Offer a clean, intuitive, mobile-responsive user interface for accessing information.
G7 (Data Suggestion): Provide a simple mechanism for users to suggest data additions/corrections without requiring user accounts.
G8 (Platform): Launch a web application accessible via modern browsers.
2.2. Non-Goals (for MVP v1.0)

Graphical network visualization UI.
User accounts and authentication.
Saving or sharing specific searches or pages.
Displaying or searching song lyrics.
User annotation features (like Genius).
Including detailed credits beyond primary songwriters and producers (e.g., engineers, instrumentalists).
Covering genres outside mainstream pop or eras before 2000 extensively.
Monetization features.
Linux support for any potential related tooling (web app is platform agnostic).
3. Target Audience (MVP)

Music enthusiasts focused on mainstream pop from 2000 onwards.
Industry professionals, journalists, and researchers interested in songwriter credits and relationships within this specific scope.
4. Architecture

Web Application: Standard client-server web application architecture.
Frontend: Single Page Application (SPA) built with React/Next.js (preferred). Responsible for UI, data fetching, search/filter interface. Mobile-first responsive design.
Backend: API server built with Python (Flask/Django preferred). Responsible for:
Serving data to the frontend.
Interfacing with the database (Neo4j).
Interfacing with the search index (Elasticsearch/Algolia).
Handling data ingestion pipelines (from APIs, scrapers).
Receiving and storing data suggestions from the user form.
Database: Neo4j Graph Database. Stores entities (Songwriters, Artists, Songs, Albums, Producers, Awards) and their relationships (WROTE, PERFORMED, PRODUCED, APPEARS_ON, RECEIVED_AWARD, etc.).
Search Index: Elasticsearch or Algolia (or similar). Required for performant, faceted search across multiple entity types as specified in G4. Data from Neo4j will be indexed here.
Data Ingestion: Separate services or scripts responsible for:
Fetching data from approved APIs (MusicBrainz, Spotify, etc.).
Performing approved public scraping tasks (Requires specific guidance and approval from Project Owner).
Processing and verifying data before insertion into Neo4j/Search Index.
Data Suggestion Handling: A backend endpoint to receive submissions from the basic frontend form, storing them (e.g., in a separate table/database) for an internal team review/verification queue.
5. Technology Stack

Database: Neo4j (Latest stable version)
Search Index: Elasticsearch or Algolia (Team to evaluate based on features/cost/complexity)
Backend: Python (Latest stable version) with Flask or Django (Team preference). Libraries for interacting with Neo4j (e.g., neo4j-python-driver) and the chosen search index.
Frontend: React / Next.js (Latest stable versions) preferred. Standard tools (Node.js, npm/yarn).
Hosting: Suitable platform for hosting the backend API, database, search index, and frontend (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku, Vercel).
6. Key Features (MVP Scope - v1.0)

F1: Songwriter Profiles: Dedicated pages displaying name, bio (if available), photo (if available), list of songs written/co-written (with links), list of artists written for (with links), list of production credits, list of awards/nominations.
F2: Artist/Song/Album Pages (Basic): Simple pages primarily serving as link hubs. Display basic identifying info (name/title, artist, release date) and lists of associated credited songwriters/producers (linking back to their profiles).
F3: Search Functionality: Search bar allowing users to query across Songwriters, Artists, Songs, and Albums. Search results page with clear categorization. Functionality target similar to Genius.com (minus lyrics).
F4: Filtering Functionality: Ability to filter search results (e.g., by entity type: Songwriter, Artist, Song). Ability to filter lists on profile pages (e.g., filter songwriter's credits by Artist, Year Range, Role - Writer/Producer). Functionality target similar to Genius.com.
F5: Data Suggestion Form: A basic, accessible form (e.g., link on page footers or a dedicated page) allowing users to submit corrections or additions without logging in. Submissions feed into an internal review queue.
F6: Mobile Responsiveness: All pages and features MUST be fully functional and usable on modern mobile web browsers.
7. Detailed Functionality

7.1. Data Display

Songwriter pages must clearly present all required fields (bio, credits, awards). Credit lists should be sortable/filterable (by year, song title, artist, role).
Artist/Song/Album pages should clearly display basic info and provide prominent links to associated Songwriter/Producer profiles.
Data should be cleanly formatted and readable on all screen sizes.
7.2. Search & Filtering

Implement backend search API leveraging the chosen search index (Elasticsearch/Algolia).
Support querying across multiple fields and entity types.
Implement frontend UI for submitting search queries and displaying results.
Implement frontend filtering controls for search results and potentially for lists on profile pages (as defined in F4). Filters should update results dynamically.
7.3. Data Suggestion Workflow

Frontend form: Include fields for Page/Entity reference, Type of issue (e.g., Missing Credit, Incorrect Credit, New Info), Detailed description/suggestion, Optional contact email (for clarification).
Backend endpoint: Receive form data, perform basic validation, store submission in a dedicated database table/collection marked as "pending review".
Internal Process (Manual): Team needs a process to review pending suggestions, verify them against reliable sources, and update the Neo4j database and Search Index accordingly. Mark suggestions as processed/rejected.
7.4. Data Ingestion & Scraping

Develop scripts/services to interact with approved public APIs (e.g., MusicBrainz). Handle rate limiting and data mapping.
Develop specific, targeted scraping modules only after receiving guidance and approval from the Project Owner on targets and methods. Scraping MUST respect robots.txt and Terms of Service. Implement responsibly (e.g., appropriate delays, user agent).
Implement data cleaning, disambiguation (using IDs, flagging name conflicts), and verification logic within the ingestion pipeline.
8. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Principles

Design Responsibility: Development team.
Core Principles: Clean, data-focused, intuitive navigation, professional aesthetic. Prioritize clear information hierarchy, especially on songwriter pages. Ensure search/filter controls are easy to discover and use. Mobile-first approach.
9. Performance Requirements & Considerations

Database Query Speed: Neo4j queries for profile data and relationships must be optimized.
Search Speed: Search results via Elasticsearch/Algolia should be near-instantaneous.
API Response Times: Backend API endpoints should respond quickly to frontend requests.
Frontend Performance: React/Next.js application should load quickly and feel responsive, especially on mobile. Optimize bundle sizes and rendering.
10. Security Requirements

Standard web application security practices (e.g., input validation, protection against XSS, CSRF if forms become more complex).
Secure configuration of database and search index (access controls, network security).
Responsible handling of any optional contact info submitted via the suggestion form.
Ensure scraping activities do not violate terms of service or appear malicious.
11. Browser Support

Latest 2 stable versions of major evergreen browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari (desktop and mobile).
12. Testing Requirements

Backend: Unit and integration tests for API endpoints, database interactions, data ingestion logic.
Frontend: Unit and integration tests for components, state management, API interactions. E2E tests for core user flows (search, filter, navigating profiles).
Data: Tests or validation scripts to check data consistency and integrity post-ingestion.
Manual QA: Qualitative feedback focus. Verify data accuracy, search/filter correctness, usability across devices.
13. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

Implement the interactive network visualization layer.
Introduce user accounts (for saving, personalization, enhanced contributions).
Expand data scope (more genres, earlier eras, deeper credits).
Refine data suggestion/verification workflow (potentially with user reputation).
Add lyrics.
Add annotation features.
Saving/Sharing features.
14. Open Issues / Risks

Risk (High): Data Acquisition & Accuracy remains the primary challenge. Sourcing reliable producer and award data, vetting sources, and managing user suggestions effectively requires significant, ongoing effort.
Risk (Medium): Achieving Genius.com-level search/filter functionality requires expertise in configuring and optimizing the chosen search index (Elasticsearch/Algolia).
Risk (Medium): Ensuring ethical and legally compliant scraping requires careful planning and adherence to guidelines.
Risk (Low): Managing scope creep for a small team with no fixed timeline/budget requires strong internal discipline.
