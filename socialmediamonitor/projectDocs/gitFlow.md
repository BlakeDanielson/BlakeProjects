1. Branching Strategy (Simplified GitHub Flow)

main Branch:

This is your primary branch. It should always represent the stable, production-ready, or latest officially released version of your project.
Rule: Never commit directly to main. All changes come into main via Pull Requests (PRs) from other branches.
Think of main as the definitive source of truth for what's "live" or "released".
Feature/Topic Branches:

Purpose: All new development work (features, bug fixes, refactoring, experiments) happens on these branches.
Creation: When you start working on something new, create a new branch from the latest main.
Bash

# Make sure your local main is up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to your new branch
git checkout -b feature/add-user-login # Or bugfix/fix-typo, refactor/database-cleanup, etc.
Naming: Use descriptive names. Prefixes like feature/, bugfix/, refactor/, chore/ help organize them (e.g., feature/user-authentication, bugfix/fix-login-redirect).
Development: Make your commits on this branch. Commit frequently with clear, concise messages. Push your branch to GitHub regularly to back it up.
Bash

git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement basic user login form" # Example using conventional commits
git push -u origin feature/add-user-login # Use -u on the first push to link local/remote
Merging Back into main (Using Pull Requests - YES, even solo!)

Create a Pull Request (PR): Once your feature or fix is complete on its branch, go to GitHub and create a Pull Request. Target main as the base branch and your feature branch as the compare branch.
Why PRs solo?
Self-Review: It gives you a dedicated place to review your own changes before merging. You might catch typos, forgotten debug code, or logical errors.
CI/CD Integration: If you set up GitHub Actions (highly recommended!), the PR is the trigger point for running automated tests, linters, and builds. This ensures your changes don't break anything before they hit main.
Clear History: PRs provide a documented record of why a set of changes was made and merged.
Review & Merge: Review the changes in the PR interface on GitHub. If you have automated checks, wait for them to pass. Once satisfied, merge the PR into main using GitHub's interface (often "Squash and merge" or "Merge commit" - "Squash and merge" keeps the main history cleaner for smaller features).
Delete Branch: After merging, delete the feature branch (GitHub usually offers a button, and you can delete the local one too: git branch -d feature/add-user-login).
Workflow Summary:

Ensure main is up-to-date (git checkout main, git pull origin main).
Create a new branch for your task (git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature).
Develop, commit, and push frequently on the feature branch.
When ready, create a Pull Request on GitHub targeting main.
Review the PR (and let automated checks run).
Merge the PR into main.
Delete the feature branch.
Repeat.
2. Versioning Strategy

Semantic Versioning (SemVer): This is the standard and highly recommended. Versions are formatted as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3).
MAJOR: Increment when you make incompatible API changes (breaking changes).
MINOR: Increment when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
PATCH: Increment when you make backward-compatible bug1 fixes.

Git Tags: Use Git tags to mark specific points in your history—usually commits on main—as specific version releases.
Creating a Tag: Once a PR representing a new release (or a collection of features/fixes ready for release) is merged into main, tag that merge commit:
Bash

# Make sure you are on the main branch and it's up-to-date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create an annotated tag (recommended - includes metadata)
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0 - Initial release with core features"

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.0.0
# Or push all tags: git push origin --tags
GitHub Releases: Complement Git tags by creating a "Release" on GitHub.
Go to your repository on GitHub > "Releases" > "Create a new release" or "Draft a new release".
Choose the tag you just pushed (e.g., v1.0.0).
Give it a title (e.g., "Version 1.0.0").
Write release notes describing the changes (what's new, bugs fixed). You can often auto-generate these from PRs/commits.
Optionally attach build artifacts (e.g., executables, compiled assets).
Benefits of this Combined Approach:

Safety: Your main branch always reflects a working state. You aren't breaking the core codebase while experimenting.
Organization: Feature branches keep different lines of work isolated.
Clear History: PRs and tags provide context for what changed, why, and when specific versions were released.
Rollback Capability: If a release has issues, you can easily identify the previous tag/state on main.
Automation Friendly: PRs are the hook for CI/CD pipelines (testing, building).


3. Testing Strategy Integration

Testing is a critical part of the development workflow and should be integrated at multiple stages:

* **Local Testing:** Before creating a PR, run relevant tests locally to verify your changes work as expected.
* **PR Testing:** Automated tests should run on every PR as part of CI/CD checks.
* **Pre-Release Testing:** More comprehensive test suites should run before tagging a new version.

Follow the [Comprehensive Testing Plan](../documentation/development-progress.md#comprehensive-testing-plan) for detailed guidance on unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches for each phase of development.
Scalability: This workflow scales easily if you bring on another team member.
