# Deployment and Operations Guide

This document describes the deployment process and operational considerations for the GuardianLens platform MVP.

## Deployment Process

The GuardianLens platform consists of a Flutter frontend (web and mobile) and a Python/FastAPI backend with Celery workers.

*   **Flutter Web:** Deployed as static assets to hosting services like Firebase Hosting, Vercel, or S3+CloudFront (Section 8, `Tech_Stack.md`).
*   **Flutter Mobile:** Deployed through App Store Connect (iOS) and Google Play Console (Android) (Section 8, `Tech_Stack.md`).
*   **Backend/Analysis/Celery:** Packaged as Docker containers and orchestrated via Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) or deployed to a PaaS like Cloud Run, App Runner, or Heroku (Section 8, `Tech_Stack.md`).

Deployment is automated via CI/CD pipelines.

## Infrastructure Setup

The required infrastructure includes:
*   Container orchestration platform (Kubernetes or PaaS).
*   Managed PostgreSQL database instance (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) (Section 3, `Tech_Stack.md`).
*   Managed Redis instance for caching and Celery message broker (AWS ElastiCache, Google Memorystore) (Section 3, `Tech_Stack.md`).
*   Static hosting for the Flutter web application.
*   Email provider API for notifications (AWS SES, SendGrid) (Section 7, `Tech_Stack.md`).
*   Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for mobile push notifications (Section 7, `Tech_Stack.md`).

## CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD pipeline is used for automated testing, building, and deployment (Section 8, `Tech_Stack.md`). Options include GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Codemagic, or Bitrise. The pipeline should include steps for:
*   Code linting and formatting.
*   Running unit, integration, and end-to-end tests as defined in the [Comprehensive Testing Plan](./development-progress.md#comprehensive-testing-plan).
*   Building Docker images for the backend.
*   Building Flutter web and mobile artifacts.
*   Deploying to staging and production environments.

## Monitoring and Alerting

Robust monitoring and alerting are essential for operational reliability (NFR 5.6, `Tech_Spec.md`).
*   Monitor application logs for errors and exceptions.
*   Monitor system metrics (CPU, memory, network).
*   Monitor database and cache performance.
*   Monitor YouTube API quota usage and error rates (REQ-D06).
*   Set up alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, and API issues.
