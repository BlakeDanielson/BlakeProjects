# GuardianLens Backend Development Progress

This document tracks the progress of the GuardianLens backend development, outlining completed tasks and planned next steps.

## Completed Tasks

Based on the task initiated on April 22, 2025, the following has been completed:

-   **Database Layer Implementation:**
    -   Defined SQLAlchemy models for all key entities (`ParentUser`, `ChildProfile`, `LinkedAccount`, `SubscribedChannel`, `AnalyzedVideo`, `AnalysisResult`, `Alert`, `AuditLog`).
    -   Set up the database connection and session management using environment variables (`backend/database.py`).
    -   Implemented a modular repository pattern (`backend/repositories/`) providing basic CRUD operations for each entity.
    -   Created a data service layer (`backend/services/data_service.py`) to encapsulate common database interactions.
    -   Integrated database session management and repositories into the Celery scan task (`backend/main.py`) for storing fetched data and analysis results.
    -   Implemented a basic encryption utility (`backend/utils/encryption.py`) and integrated it into the `LinkedAccountRepository` for secure storage of OAuth tokens.
    -   Ensured adherence to secure coding practices by using environment variables for credentials and implementing token encryption.

-   **Testing Suite Development:**
    -   Developed comprehensive unit and integration tests for the backend components.
    -   Created tests for Database Models, Repositories, Data Services, FastAPI Endpoints (Authentication), and Celery Task Integration.
    -   Followed TDD principles, focusing on modularity, coverage, and clarity.

-   **YouTube Account Linking (REQ-L01):**
    -   Implemented OAuth 2.0 flow for linking YouTube accounts to child profiles.
    -   Created utility functions for generating authorization URLs, exchanging codes for tokens, and refreshing tokens.
    -   Added new API endpoints for initiating the linking process and handling OAuth callbacks.
    -   Implemented secure state token generation and validation using JWT.
    -   Added comprehensive test coverage for OAuth utilities and API endpoints.
    -   Created detailed documentation for the YouTube account linking feature.
    -   Ensured all OAuth credentials are loaded from environment variables.

-   **Completed Backend Development Tasks (April 22, 2025):**
    -   **FastAPI Endpoints**: Created dedicated router files for SubscribedChannel, AnalyzedVideo, and AnalysisResult entities with full CRUD operations. Added a new scan router for triggering content analysis.
    -   **Celery Task Integration**: Refined the perform_account_scan task to better utilize database models and repositories. Added a new perform_scheduled_scans task for batch processing.
    -   **Session Management**: Implemented proper database session management in all endpoints using the get_db dependency with appropriate error handling.
    -   **Data Validation**: Utilized Pydantic models for request and response data validation in all API endpoints.
    -   **Authentication and Authorization**: Integrated user authentication using JWT tokens and implemented authorization checks to ensure users can only access their own data.

## Next Steps
## Comprehensive Testing Plan

This section outlines the detailed plan for implementing comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the GuardianLens project.

### Testing Strategy

The testing strategy focuses on a multi-layered approach to ensure the reliability, robustness, and security of the application. We will prioritize testing critical paths and high-risk areas, progressively increasing test coverage across all components.

### Phases

1.  **Phase 1: Unit Testing (Current)**: Focus on testing individual functions, methods, and classes in isolation. Ensure each unit of code performs as expected.
2.  **Phase 2: Integration Testing**: Test the interaction between different modules and services (e.g., database interactions, API endpoint calls, service-to-service communication).
3.  **Phase 3: End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Simulate user scenarios to test the entire application flow from the frontend to the backend and external services.
4.  **Phase 4: Performance and Load Testing**: Evaluate the system's performance under various load conditions to identify bottlenecks and ensure scalability.
5.  **Phase 5: Security Testing**: Conduct vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews to identify and mitigate security risks.

### Test Types

-   **Unit Tests**: Using frameworks like `pytest` (Python) and `flutter_test` (Dart).
-   **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between backend services, database, and external APIs. Testing frontend component interactions and data flow.

## Comprehensive Testing Plan

This document outlines the strategy, phases, types, priorities, resources, timeline, and coverage criteria for testing the Social Media Monitor application.

### 1. Testing Strategy

Our strategy employs a multi-layered approach, combining unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) testing to ensure application quality, reliability, and security. We will follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where feasible, particularly for backend logic and critical frontend components. Testing will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to provide continuous feedback.

### 2. Testing Phases

Testing will be conducted in the following phases, aligned with the development lifecycle:

*   **Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Current Sprint)**
    *   Establish testing frameworks (Pytest for backend, Flutter testing tools for frontend).
    *   Implement initial unit tests for core models, repositories, and utility functions.
    *   Set up basic CI pipeline integration for running tests automatically.
*   **Phase 2: Core Feature Testing (Sprints 2-4)**
    *   Develop unit tests for all new backend services and router endpoints.
    *   Implement integration tests for critical workflows (e.g., user authentication, data fetching, risk analysis).
    *   Write widget tests for core UI components and screens in the frontend.
    *   Begin E2E testing for primary user flows (login, profile creation, dashboard view).
*   **Phase 3: Comprehensive Coverage (Sprints 5-7)**
    *   Increase unit and integration test coverage across backend and frontend.
    *   Expand E2E tests to cover edge cases, error handling, and different user roles/permissions.
    *   Implement security testing (dependency scanning, basic vulnerability checks).
    *   Conduct performance testing on key APIs and database queries.
*   **Phase 4: Pre-Release & Regression (Sprint 8)**
    *   Execute full regression testing suite.
    *   Perform usability testing (manual or automated).
    *   Finalize security audits.
    *   Ensure all high-priority bugs are resolved.
*   **Phase 5: Maintenance & Continuous Improvement (Post-Launch)**
    *   Continuously add tests for new features and bug fixes.
    *   Regularly review and update existing tests.
    *   Monitor test execution results and address failures promptly.
