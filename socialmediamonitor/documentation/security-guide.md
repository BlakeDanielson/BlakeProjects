# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the specific security measures implemented in the GuardianLens project MVP.

## Secure Token Management

OAuth tokens obtained from Google for child account linking (REQ-L04) and parent JWTs (Section 6, `Tech_Stack.md`) must be stored and managed securely.
*   Tokens should be encrypted at rest.
*   Access to token storage should be restricted using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (NFR 5.1, `Tech_Spec.md`).
*   Flutter's `flutter_secure_storage` is recommended for storing API tokens on mobile devices (Section 1, `Tech_Stack.md`). Backend token storage requires a robust solution, potentially leveraging cloud-managed secrets services.

## Input Validation and Sanitization

Strict input validation and sanitization must be applied to all data received from users (parents, children via OAuth) and external APIs (YouTube Data API). This prevents common vulnerabilities like injection attacks.

## API Security

Internal backend APIs should be secured:
*   Authentication for parent users via JWTs (Section 6, `Tech_Stack.md`).
*   Authorization checks (RBAC) to ensure users can only access data they are permitted to see (NFR 5.1, `Tech_Spec.md`).
*   Rate limiting to protect against abuse and denial-of-service attacks.

## Secrets Management

All sensitive configuration data, including API keys (e.g., YouTube API credentials), database credentials, and email provider API keys, must be managed securely.
*   Secrets should be stored outside of the codebase, preferably using environment variables or a dedicated secret management system (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager).

## Compliance

Adherence to data privacy regulations and platform policies is a critical security and privacy measure (NFR 5.8, `Tech_Spec.md`).
*   **COPPA:** Implement Verifiable Parental Consent (VPC) for children under 13 (REQ-L07, Section 11.1, `Tech_Spec.md`).
*   **GDPR:** Ensure compliance with GDPR principles, including data minimization, user rights (access, deletion), and lawful processing.
*   **YouTube Data API ToS & Google API Services User Data Policy:** Strictly adhere to Google's policies regarding the access and use of YouTube data.

## Audits and Testing

Regular security testing, as outlined in the [Comprehensive Testing Plan](./development-progress.md#comprehensive-testing-plan), is essential (NFR 5.1, `Tech_Spec.md`).
*   Include security reviews and potentially external vulnerability scanning and penetration testing before launch (Section 7, `PRD.md`).
