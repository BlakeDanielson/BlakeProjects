# Cache Security Considerations

This document outlines the security considerations for the in-memory cache implemented in `backend/data_fetching/cache.py`.

## In-Memory Cache Risks

The current caching mechanism uses a simple in-memory dictionary. While this provides fast access to cached data, it has inherent security risks, particularly if sensitive information is stored:

*   **Vulnerability to Memory Inspection:** Data stored in memory can potentially be accessed by other processes or attackers if the system is compromised.
*   **No Encryption at Rest:** Data in the in-memory cache is not encrypted, making it readable if the memory is accessed.
*   **Limited Scalability and Persistence:** In-memory caches are tied to the lifespan of the application process. Restarting the application clears the cache. This is not a security risk in itself, but a limitation to consider for data availability.

**Therefore, it is strongly recommended that sensitive data (e.g., user credentials, private messages, personally identifiable information) SHOULD NOT be stored in this in-memory cache.**

## Appropriate Use Cases

This in-memory cache is suitable for caching non-sensitive, frequently accessed data that can be easily re-fetched if the cache is cleared. Examples include:

*   Public channel metadata
*   Lists of public videos
*   Configuration settings that are not sensitive

## Alternatives and Enhancements (Future Scope)

For caching sensitive data or for improved security and persistence, consider the following alternatives in future iterations:

*   **Using a Secure Caching System:** Implement a dedicated caching system like Redis or Memcached with appropriate security configurations (e.g., authentication, encryption in transit).
*   **Database Caching:** Utilize database-level caching mechanisms if the data is already stored in a secure database.
*   **Encryption:** If sensitive data *must* be cached (with careful consideration of the risks), implement encryption of the data before storing it in the cache. This would require careful key management.

A full migration to a more secure caching solution is outside the scope of the current MVP but should be prioritized for future development if sensitive data caching becomes necessary.
