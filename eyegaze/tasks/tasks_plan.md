- Beginning research phase for AI libraries and virtual camera implementations
- Setting up initial development environment

## Known Issues

1. **Technical Complexity**: Achieving natural gaze correction with local processing is challenging.
2. **Performance Target**: Meeting the <100ms latency target requires significant optimization.
3. **DOC/DOCX Conversion**: Finding a reliable local solution for file conversion.
4. **Screen Capture Resistance**: Technical limitations may exist in making the overlay fully resistant.
5. **Platform Support**: Virtual camera implementation differs significantly between platforms.

## Next Milestone Goals
